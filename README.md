Night at the Museum Project - By Michelle Mboya
Versions used:
Unity 2017.1.0p4
GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

This is a Demo Scene Project that looks at the various ways in which Data Visualization is being done in Virtual Reality. The main scene is my Data Tree which is a play on Data Structures. Each branch has a scene attached to it that explores some aspect of Virtual Reality Data Visualitzation. The scenes are:
1) Companies doing Virtual Reality Data Visualization - watch three videos about different companies
2) Music Visualization - Play around with different sounds to see different visualizations of the rhythm (
3) Create your own graph - A simple scene that lets you drag and drop objects in a 3D graph space
4) Women in Science - A slow roller coatser journey in space with stops that spotlight different women in science over time. 
5) Explore a 3D Network Graph - A 3D Network Graph with a moving node. Users can move from node to node by clicking on them or choose to move along the graph with the camera.
